# Digituz Dashboard

This project is composed by two main sub-projects: the `api` and the `ui`. You will find instructions on how to run each one on the README files that accompanies them but, in summary, they are:

- `api`: a Nest.js project
- `ui`: an Angular project

Also, you will find two other directories on the project root:

- `bin`: this directory contains scripts to migrate data from Bling to this system
- `deployment`: this directory contains a script to deploy sub-projects to production

Check these directories for README files.
