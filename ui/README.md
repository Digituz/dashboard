# UI Development Process

The UI is based on Angular. More specifically, on [the `ngx-rocket/starter-kit` project](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/starter-kit).

To start developing, make sure you have an [API](../api/README.md) up and running, then issue the following commands:

```bash
npm install

npm start
```
